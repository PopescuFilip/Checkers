This program simulates playing checkers;
Two players (one with red pieces one with 
white pieces) take turn moving pieces;
The player with red pieces always makes
the first move
The pieces can move diagonally one space
or, when possible they can jump over enemy
pieces, capturing them;
The game ends when one of the players doesn't
have any remaining pieces.
